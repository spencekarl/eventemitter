EventEmitter
============

Export an `EventEmitter` class in `index.js` that satisfies all unit tests
in the `mochaTest:core` task.

Bonus points will be given for implementations that satisfy the extra tests
in the `mochaTest:bonus` task.

No additional dependencies should be installed, and Node's built-in `events`
module may not be used.

Examples and documentation can be found in [docs.md](./docs.md).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
3. Install Grunt (`npm install -g grunt-cli`)
